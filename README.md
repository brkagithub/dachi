# Create T3 App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

TODO:

- separate page to verify riot accounts
- support multiple riot accounts instead of one
- live searching for party/clash
- other games
- reviews
- next image (kinda done)
- unblock list
- SEO twitter cards for example (kinda done)
- prettier logo etc?
- search
- when you name change chat gets weird - change recipientName to recipientId on chat page or make name not changeable
- updating riot acc lasts too long sometimes
